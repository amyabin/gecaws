Reconstruction of the roadway requires installation of a culvert within San Pablo Creek, backfilled with engineered fill, to buttress the landslide and provide a stabilized footing for the roadway embankment. An offsite mitigation area is included as part of the project.\n\nProject Related Documents\nVia Verdi Slope Stabilization Project\nResponse to Comments\nMitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan\nReview and Comment Period: Comments on the MND shall be sent in writing and must be received by 5:00 p.m. on Thursday, November 27, 2019, at the following address or email:\nLina Velasco\nCity of Richmond Planning Division\n450 Civic Center Plaza\nP.O.

        "description": "Travel Safe Richmond is the City\u2019s two-pronged approach to improving roadway safety for all users: people walking, biking, rolling, and driving. All components of Travel Safe Richmond are working together to create unified policies and infrastructure recommendations for improving roadway conditions throughout the City of Richmond. Input from City stakeholders and community members is a critical component of this effort.\nComponents of Travel Safe Richmond\nThe two components of the Travel Safe Richmond project include:\nLocal Roadway Safety Plan\nTraffic safety impacts the health and comfort of all those who live and travel in the City of Richmond. The Local Roadway Safety Plan (LRSP) will identify traffic safety trends, and develop a program for the funding and implementation of improvements. The implementation of this plan is a step towards making the transportation system safe and more equitable for users of all transportation modes.\nThe LRSP\u2019s primary goals include:\nReduce fatal and serious injury collisions\nEnsure equitable traffic safety investments in the neighborhoods that need them most\nSupport safe travel for people walking and biking, especially near schools and other high-demand areas\nEncourage safe driving, through roadway design and outreach\nPrepare for the future with climate-resilient transportation safety infrastructure\nThe Local Roadway Safety Plan was approved by the City Council on July 19, 2023.\nLRSP's Adoption Consideration: July 19, 2023\nAdopted Resolution No. 105-22 and Final Local Roadway Safety Plan\nBicycle and Pedestrian Action Plan\nThe Bicycle and Pedestrian Action Plan (BPAP) will serve as the blueprint for improving walking and bicycling conditions in the City of Richmond for the next five years. This Plan will consolidate recommendations from the Local Roadway Safety Plan (LRSP) and coordinate with other Richmond planning efforts to provide near-term bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure recommendations. The proposed improvements will make it safer, easier, and more practical to walk, bike, roll and access transit throughout the City of Richmond.\nGoals for the B/P Action Plan include:\nDevelop a recommended bicycle and pedestrian network that builds on Richmond's existing assets and focuses on closing existing gaps\nDevelop a list of near-term (1-3 year) infrastructure projects focusing on bicycle and pedestrian safety and comfort\nDevelop an implementation strategy that identifies potential funding opportunities and applies those to each project\nDevelop a general set of guidelines for the development and implementation of bicycle facilities and off-street paths\nThe Bicycle and Pedestrian Action Plan had a study session on October 25, 2022 and was adopted by City Council on February 7, 2023. \nBPAP's City Council Adoption Consideration: February 7, 2023\nAdopted Resolution No. 9-23 and Final Bicycle and Pedestrian Action Plan\nProject Timeline\nThe project was developed in two distinct phases as noted in the graphic below.\nTravel Safe Richmond Community Workshops\nThroughout the development of Travel Safe Richmond, the City organized a number of events and digital opportunities, including community workshops/open houses, pop up events, and presenting to the business community and at several neighborhood council meetings to gather the public's feedback and ideas. All two components of the Project will coordinate their community engagement into one unified process. \n1st Community Workshop: December 8, 2021\nPresentation\n2nd Community Workshop: May 18, 2022 (In person)\nFlyer\n3rd Community Workshop: November 9, 2022\nPresentation\n\nContact Us\nIf you have any comments or questions about the project, you can reach project planer, Lydia Elias at travelsafe@ci.richmond.ca.us.

The project involves construction of a  700,000 square foot logistics building and associated parking, loading, and landscaping. The new building would include 40,000 square feet of office space and 687,820 square feet of warehouse space.  The height of the building would vary from 40 to 45 feet, and its length would be 1,506 feet. The site previously included two manufacturing buildings and one office building totaling approximately 593,500 square feet. The footprint of the new building would be similar as that of the previous structures. A  total of 427 vehicle parking spaces and 105 bicycles stalls are proposed for employees. Drive alsles on the site are proposed to be 25 and 30 feet wide for the employee parking area and the truck access area. Access to and from the site site would be via an existing access driveway off Atlas Road. No new driveways are proposed. \n\nProject and Related Documents\nNotice of Comment Period Extension for the Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration (New End of Comment Period: May 26, 2015)\nNotice of Availability and Intent to Adopt a Mitigated Negative Declaration\nInitial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration (End of Public Review: May 11, 2015)\nFinal Mitigated Negative Declaration and Mitigation and Monitoring Reporting Program",

The Richmond-Ohlone Greenway Gap Closure Project represents the third phase of the Richmond Greenway Project, which would provide a continuous bicycle and pedestrian pathway in Richmond from Garrard Boulevard and the Richmond Parkway to San Pablo Avenue. The Richmond Greenway would connect the San Francisco Bay Trail at the west with the Ohlone Greenway in the City of El Cerrito at the east. The proposed project includes installation of the new multi-use trail, a new crosswalk and traffic signal on San Pablo Avenue, and a new bridge over realigned Baxter Creek as well as associated improvements and landscaping.\n\nEnvironmental Review\nAn Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration was prepared for this project and is available below. The basis for proposing a Mitigated Negative Declaration was the finding that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, implementation of proposed mitigation measures will reduce all impacts to a less-than-significant level.

The proposed improvements include construction of a new diversion box, pump station, pipeline, and an above ground, circular, pre-stressed concrete tank with storage volume of approximately 5 million gallons. The tank will be approximately 150 feet in diameter and approximately 53 feet tall. Water Pollution Control Plant effluent will be used to supply water to the wash down system used to clean the tank. The tank will be covered to contain odors.
